# Changelog

## 2.0.0

The theme has been updated to use a generator to keep it aligned with the original Nord theme. This means a more consistent experience for those who are using this as a light version of the Nord theme. It also makes it easier to add new ports from the existing Nord implementations, which should hopefully allow me to maintain more Polar implementations with less work.

However, this did mean that some of the hand-written ports have changed slightly, as they used to use colors or designs that didn't match up with the original Nord theme. If you prefer those theme implementations instead, they will continue to exist in their pre-2.0.0 state in the `legacy` directory, but will not receive further updates (feel free to make Pull Requests for updates if you want to maintain them further).

### New

* Code Generated Themes for more consistency with Nord
