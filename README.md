# Polar
A light colour scheme based on [@arcticicestudio's Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) scheme.

> Note (2023-02-23): I'm aware a couple of the implementations have issues at the moment, I'm working on updating all the themes and will push updates soon!

## Included:

* Firefox
* iTerm2
* Jetbrains IDEs (editor theme, UI theme WIP)
* Kitty terminal
* Mac Terminal.app
* Slack
* Tmux
* Vscode
* Xcode
* Xfce Terminal
* Sublime Text

There used to be a Vim theme here too, however I found that it worked better when left to the normal terminal
colours. For this I used one of the polar terminal themes with https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim to
get the required colors.
