# Polar

Polar is a colour scheme based on [@arcticicestudio's Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord).

The Polar scheme uses the colours from Nord as-is, adding a pure white (`#FFFFFF`) background and reversing the roles of the  `Polar Night` and `Snow Storm` palettes from the original Nord theme.

There is also a generator to rebuild the theme from the latest Nord themes where applicable, to make maintenence easier for a larger range of ports! The generator is written in Swift.

See the CHANGELOG for details on differences from 2.0.0 onwards.
