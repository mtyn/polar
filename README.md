# Polar
A light colour scheme based on [@arcticeicestudio's Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) scheme.

## Included:

* Firefox
* iTerm2
* Jetbrains IDEs (editor theme, UI theme WIP)
* Kitty terminal
* Mac Terminal.app
* Slack
* Tmux
* Vscode
* Xcode
* Xfce Terminal

There used to be a Vim theme here too, however I found that it worked better when left to the normal terminal
colours. For this I used one of the polar terminal themes with https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim to
get the required colors.

Screenshots of the theme in some of the apps are shown below.

Things on the todo list:

- [] Fix the background color to a lighter shade to make some colors more readable
     (potentially as an option to the standard Nord light color)
- [] Remake some of the themes that use colors that don't match the original Nord theme colors
