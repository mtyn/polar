# Polar

Polar is a pair of light colour schemes based on [@arcticicestudio's Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord).

The original **Polar** scheme uses the colours from Nord as-is, adding a pure white (`#FFFFFF`) background and reversing the roles of the  `Polar Night` and `Snow Storm` palettes from the original Nord theme.

**New**: As some of the colors from the original palette are not very well contrasted for light backgrounds, also included is a variation, **Stark Polar**, which uses slightly adjusted colors from the original Nord scheme to have better contrast on light backgrounds while keeping the feel of the original.

There is also a generator to rebuild the themes from the latest Nord themes where applicable, to make maintenence easier for a larger range of ports! The generator is written in Swift.

## Included:

* Firefox
* iTerm2
* Jetbrains IDEs (editor theme, UI theme WIP)
* Kitty terminal
* Mac Terminal.app
* Slack
* Tmux
* Vscode
* Xcode
* Xfce Terminal
* Sublime Text

There used to be a Vim theme here too, however I found that it worked better when left to the normal terminal
colours. For this I used one of the polar terminal themes with https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim to
get the required colors.
